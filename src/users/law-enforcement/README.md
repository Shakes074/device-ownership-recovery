# Law Enforcement Portal

This directory stores documentation and role-specific assets for the Law Enforcement experience.

- Feature components live in `src/features/law`. (To be populated)
- Update `src/users/config.js` and `routes.js` when new screens are added.

Add PRDs, wireframes, or notes here to keep law-enforcement requirements close to the code.
